cmar
====
The beginning of an implementation of CMAR (Classification based on Multiple
Association Rules). You can compile and run with:

`make x`

but it only builds a FP-tree and immediately releases it and returns. You also need
[MATIO](http://sourceforge.net/projects/matio/) library to read .mat files. 

Despite appearances, there is no unit test.
